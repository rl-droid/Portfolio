        <h2>Looking to the Future</h2>
        <p>April 9, 2023<br>Today is Easter Sunday in my first year of university. Finals are in three weeks, and the only thing I can think about is where I will work over the summer. I need three internships to graduate, and from there I need to figure out if I will be in politics, entertainment, or broadcast news.<br>Working for BUTV has made me fall in love with broadcast, but the rigid gender standards that come with that industry would be limiting and uncomfortable. Writing for The Scout has made me love writing entertainment news- reviews of movies, albums, TV shows, or keeping up with Hollywood affairs. It's all a lot of fun and I think I could fit into the scene. But is it fulfilling? Then there's politics. I would go to law school if I followed this road. I think I would enjoy law school, and honestly I'll take as much time in school as I can get. Writing about politics would be a public service. I don't know if I would work somewhere that lets me write the truth about politics, though, and I would never present a dissenting opinion as "alternative facts."<br>So, what do I do? Right now, I'm just going to work at Hot Topic and hope the answer becomes more clear with time.</p>
